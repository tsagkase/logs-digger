# Logs digger

Navigate through the logs performing a basic set of actions:

1. [`browse-logs.sh`](./browse-logs.sh) Search for entry in logs
1. [`extract-logged-event.sh`](./extract-logged-event.sh) View whole (possibly multiline) logged event 
1. [`find-in-source.sh`](./find-in-source.sh) Look for references / definition of class method in source
1. Open code in editor


## Misc

- The [just-b4-restart.sh](./just-b4-restart.sh) script shows process restarts (PID change) along with previous log entry (reason for crash?)
- Convenience function [`remove-unprintables.sh`](./remove-unprintables.sh) is provided to clean up unprintable UTF-8 usually found in logs.


## Status

Currently a basic implementation of all the steps has been implemented.
